Developed a machine learning model for predicting housing prices utilizing the California housing dataset. 
The project encompassed data exploration, preprocessing, and model training using linear regression, followed 
by evaluation using Mean Squared Error. The implementation leveraged Python and prominent libraries such as 
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Joblib.
